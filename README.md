This project analyzes recent public sentiment toward Men’s Wearhouse using a lightweight natural language processing (NLP) approach. A small sample of English-language posts from X (formerly Twitter) was examined to understand how customers perceive key aspects of the brand, including pricing, tailoring, customer service, and in-store experience.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how unstructured social media data can be translated into actionable business insights within a retail context.
